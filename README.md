# 🔐 Real-Time Ransomware Detection Based on Hybrid Algorithmic Approach

A behavior-aware cybersecurity system that enables real-time detection of ransomware attacks using a hybrid machine learning approach combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The system monitors runtime behavioral patterns, analyzes relational dependencies between processes, and classifies malicious activities with high accuracy and reduced false positives.
